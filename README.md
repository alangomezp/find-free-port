## Functionality

This application allows you to find an available port on your localhost. It can be useful when you need to run a server or any other application that requires a specific port, but you are not sure which ports are already in use.

To use this application, simply run the script and it will automatically find an available port for you. The application will scan starting from a specified port number (default is 3000) and check if each port is available. Once an available port is found, it will be displayed on the console.
